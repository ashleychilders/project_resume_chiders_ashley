**Comments**

1.) For my custom JavaScript I set an event listener of mouseover for my different sections. When the mouse hovered over a specific section I color coded it to match the color used for the navigation buttons. I did this to set the different sections apart visually.

2.) I used the backstretch plugin to have three images rotating in the background. I took these photos at the Renwick Gallery in Washington, DC.

3.) I used the smooth scroll plugin to for a seem-less scroll effect.
